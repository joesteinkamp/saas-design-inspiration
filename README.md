# Sourced - Design Inspiration
The goal of this project is to create a simple site for finding design inspiration that can be updated by anyone. There's been plenty of great app screenshot galleries that have come and gone or stopped being maintained. Hopefully, with it being open-source and maintainable by many, it will stay as useful as possible.

## How to Add to an Existing App
Pretty straight forward, just add the new screenshots to the correct folder.


## How to Add a New App
To add a new app, create a folder for it named after the App then create an `index.html` file that has `gallery-directory: {App Name}` with {App Name} replaced.
